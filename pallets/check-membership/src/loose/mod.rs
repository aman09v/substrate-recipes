//! Pallet that demonstrates a minimal access control check. When a user calls this pallet's
//! only dispatchable function, `check_membership`, the caller is checked against a set of approved
//! callers. If the caller is a member of the set, the pallet's `IsAMember` event is emitted. Otherwise a `NotAMember` error is returned.
//!
//! The list of approved members is provided by an external source and exposed through an associated
//! type in this pallet's configuration trait. Any type that implements the `AccountSet` trait can be
//! used to supply the membership set.
