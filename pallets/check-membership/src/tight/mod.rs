//! Pallet that demonstrates a minimal access control check. When a user calls this pallet's
//! only dispatchable function, `check_membership`, the caller is checked against a set of approved
//! callers. If the caller is a member of the set, the pallet's `IsAMember` event is emitted. Otherwise a `NotAMember` error is returned.
//!
//! The list of approved members is provided by the `vec-set` pallet. In order for this pallet to be
//! used, the `vec-set` pallet must also be present in the runtime.
