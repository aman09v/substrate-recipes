//! A Simple Charity which holds and governs a pot of funds.
//!
//! The Charity has a pot of funds. The Pot is unique because unlike other token-holding accounts,
//! it is not controlled by a cryptographic keypair. Rather it belongs to the pallet itself.
//! Funds can be added to the pot in two ways:
//! * Anyone can make a donation through the `donate` extrinsic.
//! * An imablance can be absorbed from somewhere else in the runtime.
//! Funds can only be allocated by a root call to the `allocate` extrinsic/
